## Project Idea 
Collect file system data by scanning a specific directory, and extract attributes such as file size, file permissions, file name, modifications, etc. With the knowledge of these attributes, a timeline will be created in order to see file acitvity in chronological order. 

This will be executed by creating a bash script that accepts the directory as its input, files in that directory will be scanned, metadata file will be extracted and then the timeline will be created based off the data being formatted. This timeline will then be outputted as a text file. 

AI Use: AI will read through the file system data that was scanned, and output results in laymans terms. This will be used by using an API key.
